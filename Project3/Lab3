Purpose: Help car buyer decided whether to buy a hybrid or non-hybrid car
Inputs:
   Miles driven per year
   Price of gas during 5 years of ownership
   Initial cost of hybrid car
   Fuel efficiency of hybrid car
   Resale value of hybrid car after 5 years
   Initial cost of non-hybrid car
   Fuel efficiency of non-hybrid car
   Resale value of non-hybrid car after 5 years
   Buyer's criterion of either minimized gas consumption or minimized total cost
Outputs:
   Prompt the user to re-enter values if negative or zero by printing out a warning if need be
   Print out whether the car specifications are for the hybrid or non-hybrid car
   Total gallons of fuel consumed over 5 years for the hybrid or non-hybrid car
   Total cost of owning the hybrid or non-hybrid car for 5 years
   Tell the buyer which car is better to purchase based on their criterion
Test Cases:
   Case 1
      Inputs:
         Miles driven per year = -10000, then 10000
         Price of gas during 5 years of ownership = 0, then 3.14
         Initial cost of hybrid car = -35000, then 35000
         Fuel efficiency of hybrid car = -57.8, then 57.8
         Resale value of hybrid car after 5 years = -23000, then 23000
         Initial cost of non-hybrid car = -1, then 42500
         Fuel efficiency of non-hybrid car = -10, then 25.6
         Resale value of non-hybrid car after 5 years = -2200, then 22000
         Buyer's criterion of either minimized gas consumption or minimized total cost = Gas
      Expected Outputs:
         All of the first numbers enter will show an error and prompt me to enter in a new value
         Total gallons of fuel consumed over 5 years for hybrid = 865.05
         Total gallons of fuel consumed over 5 years for non-hybrid = 1953.12
         Total cost of owning hybrid = 14716.26
         Total cost of owning non-hybrid = 26632.81
         Which car to buy = HYBRID
      Outputs:
         All expected outputs were correct
   Case 2
      Inputs:
         Miles driven per year = 12000
         Price of gas during 5 years of ownership = 2.50 
         Initial cost of hybrid car = 25000
         Fuel efficiency of hybrid car = 50.8
         Resale value of hybrid car after 5 years = 15000
         Initial cost of non-hybrid car = 20000
         Fuel efficiency of non-hybrid car = 23.7
         Resale value of non-hybrid car after 5 years = 10000
         Buyer's criterion of either minimized gas consumption or minimized total cost = Total
      Expected Outputs:
         Total gallons of fuel consumed over 5 years for hybrid = 1181.10
         Total gallons of fuel consumed over 5 years for non-hybrid = 2531.65
         Total cost of owning hybrid = 12952.76
         Total cost of owning non-hybrid = 16329.11
         Which car to buy = HYBRID
      Outputs:
         All expected outputs were correct
   Case 3
      Inputs:
         Miles driven per year = 2000
         Price of gas during 5 years of ownership = 1.50 
         Initial cost of hybrid car = 70000
         Fuel efficiency of hybrid car = 45.3
         Resale value of hybrid car after 5 years = 15000
         Initial cost of non-hybrid car = 18000
         Fuel efficiency of non-hybrid car = 35.7
         Resale value of non-hybrid car after 5 years = 12000
         Buyer's criterion of either minimized gas consumption or minimized total cost = Total
      Expected Outputs:
         Total gallons of fuel consumed over 5 years for hybrid = 220.75
         Total gallons of fuel consumed over 5 years for non-hybrid = 280.11
         Total cost of owning hybrid = 55331.13
         Total cost of owning non-hybrid = 6420.17
         Which car to buy = NON-HYBRID
      Outputs:
         All expected outputs were correct
